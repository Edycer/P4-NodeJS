# P4-NodeJS

NodeJS Javascript API for Perforce. 

If you are interested in using this please get in touch and I'll write some docs.

You can find some examples in p4_test.js, you just need to put your Perforce login details in p4_test_config.js to use.

Please note you need Python 2.7 installed and in your path to use this. That's because Python is the most reliable way to interface with Perforce in certain situations.
